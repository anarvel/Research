This repository contains R scripts used to analyze the relationship between genetic risk factors for psychosis and cognitive performance in pediatric and adolescent cohorts. The analysis integrates polygenic risk scores (PRS), rare genetic variants (including CNVs and SNVs), and phenotypic data to examine whether specific mutation types are associated with impairments in distinct cognitive domains.Work includes data cleaning and harmonization, carrier identification, gene-level aggregation, cognitive score processing, and exploratory statistical analyses.
